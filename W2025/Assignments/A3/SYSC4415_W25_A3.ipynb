    "## General Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Assignment can be done **in a group of two or individually**.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOU HAVE TO JOIN A GROUP ON BRIGHTSPACE TO SUBMIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please state it explicitly at the beginning of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need only one submission if it's group work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please print out values when asked using Python's print() function with f-strings where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your **saved notebook with all the outputs** to Brightspace, but ensure it will produce correct outputs upon restarting and click \"runtime\" â†’ \"run all\" with clean outputs. Ensure your notebook displays all answers correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Submission MUST contain your signature at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "In this assignment, we build a reasoning AI agent that facilitates ML operations and model evaluation. This assignment is heavily based on Tutorial 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** Submit your Notebook as a *.ipynb* file that adopts this naming convention: ***SYSC4415_W25_A3_NameLastname.ipynb*** on *Brightspace*. No other submission (e.g., through email) will be accepted. (Example file name: SYSC4415_W25_A3_IgorBogdanov.ipynb or SYSC4415_W25_A3_Student1_Student2.ipynb) The notebool MUST contain saved outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime tips:**\n",
    "Agentic programming and API calling can be easily done locally and moved to Colab in the final stages, depending on the implementation of your tools and ML tasks you want to run."
